\usage{
fetch_enr(end_year, tidy = TRUE, use_cache = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{end_year}{A school year. Year is the end of the academic year - e.g., 2023-24
school year is year '2024'. Valid values are 2014-2026.

\strong{Note on data availability:}
\itemize{
\item Years 2019-2026: Full State, LEA (district), and School-level data
\item Years 2014-2018: State-level totals only (from historical time series)
}}

\item{tidy}{If TRUE (default), returns data in long (tidy) format with subgroup
column. If FALSE, returns wide format.}

\item{use_cache}{If TRUE (default), uses locally cached data when available.
Set to FALSE to force re-download from USBE.}
}
\value{
Data frame with enrollment data. Wide format includes columns for
district_id, campus_id, names, and enrollment counts by demographic/grade.
Tidy format pivots these counts into subgroup and grade_level columns.
For years 2014-2018, only state-level totals are returned.
